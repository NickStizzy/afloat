To modify, build or examine Afloat's sources, you will need the following tools:

 - A Mac with Tiger and Xcode 2.3 or later. Leopard and Xcode 3 are likely compatible, but this is untested. Panther and Xcode versions lower than 2.3 are incompatible with the project format. 
 
 - Vectorial images are stored as Macromedia Fireworks 8 PNG files.
 
 - The PDF documentation is written using Pages 2.0.
 
All other used file formats are open or easily viewable.
