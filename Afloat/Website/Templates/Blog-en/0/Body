<p>
	So, well, this is it. Here we are, at the very moment of truth ;)
</p>
<p>
	First of all, I must thank you. All of you. In just a little over a week, I have had a grand total of <strong>one thousand and eight hundred (!!!)</strong> downloads. Ouch. I expected, like, fifty or so. Word.
</p>
<p>
	So, as a token of my gratitude, I worked my way through some bugs and some UI ugliness to make Afloat better. Although there aren't a lot of new features, I simply refined what I had already to make it better and slightly smarter. New features are being worked upon, but I'm going to do a 'pre-release 3' with them before going truly 1.0.						</p>
<p>
Having said this… <strong>I need help</strong>.</p>
<p>
	There are almost two thousands of you Afloat users out there in the world, you know? And I know but two of the many languages spoken on this Earth. And as a non-English-native-speaker, I know how important localization is. So, I'm asking you: <strong>is anyone kind enough to give some spare time for the localization of Afloat?</strong> It isn't much currently and the way I work means you aren't going to translate thousands of strings per release - more like ten-twenty at most. Not much, really.
</p>
<p>
	So, if anyone wants to help, I'm looking mainly for <strong>German, Spanish and Japanese</strong> localizers (as these are the language of the countries that, outside of the US and Italy, downloaded the most copies of Afloat). If you want to, just drop a line at <a href="mailto:millenomi+afloat@gmail.com">millenomi+afloat@gmail.com</a> or <a href="aim:GoIm?screenname=evthethinker">my AIM account</a>. Thank you!
