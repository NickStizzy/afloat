Welcome to the Afloat microverse. A "microverse" is a smaller, portable version of âˆžlabs's Multiverse code repository and building rig. This microverse contains all files you need to build Afloat on your machine.

What this microverse does not contain:
 - Packaging tools (the ones that make the DMG and web site) because, well, they're not needed and I'm pretty much ashamed of them. They're not very machine-specific, but not ready yet.
 - Localizations. They're strongly tied to the above packaging tools.
 - Code signing tools. See below.

To compile Afloat on your machine (which MUST be a machine running Mac OS X 10.5 and having Xcode 3.0 or later):

 - from a Terminal, cd into the trunk's root directory and run

	sh Bootstrap
	
which will initialize this microverse. (With the first revision this is not really needed, but it might be in the future.)

 - Compile the Afloat target of the Xcode project at Afloat/Afloat.xcodeproj.

The result will have three unavoidable warnings -- two because code signing is unused and one for the missing packaging tools. All three can be safely ignored -- they do not impact on the final product.

To sign the products with your own key, modify the "Sign Code" script phase in all targets and make sure the private key is in a keychain on the compiling machine. (This project uses a projectwide setting, USE_CODE_SIGNING, to switch code signing on or off, but not to specify what key you use to sign. This is probably a forthcoming feature.)

The missing packaging tools warning simply complains because the compilation of Afloat uses the seticon tool from http://osxtools.sf.net/ to make sure the Afloat icon is shown in the Finder. This is noncritical, and you can fix it by following the warning's instructions.
