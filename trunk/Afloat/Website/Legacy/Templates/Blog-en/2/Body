<p>A short blog article for two reasons: first, I'm testing the new web site blogging and publishing infrastructure. Second, but more important, I'm still looking for <strong>localizers of all languages</strong> â€” if you feel like translating Afloat, just drop me a line at <a href="mailto:millenomi+afloat@gmail.com">millenomi+afloat@gmail.com</a> and I'll be happy to welcome you to the team!</p>
<p>I'm planning for a release next week of what will likely be either the last pre-release or 1.0 itself (with the former more likely), so hurry up! :D</p>
