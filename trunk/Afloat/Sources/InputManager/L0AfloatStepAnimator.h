/*
** L0AfloatStepAnimator.h
** 
**   This class implements an abstract step
** animator -- an animator that defines a number
** of "steps" to be executed uniformly during
** a given period of time. Exactly how the
** animation is performed is up to the subclasses
** to decide (by implementing the
** -animateAtProgress:sliding: method).
**   The animator also implements some sliding
** prevention -- if the animation runs too slow
** and the sliding prevention policy allows it,
** the animator will skip a number of steps in
** an attempt to compensate (and prevent
** the effective duration from being too
** different than the intended one).
